# pager-lang - Roadmap

> Path from scaffold to a stable 1.0. Hard parts are front-loaded; each phase has hard exit criteria.
> Master plan: ../../_strategy/LANG_COLLECTION.md
>
> **Anti-deferral rule:** no listed hard task moves to a later phase unless this file records the move and the reason.

## v0.1.0 - Scaffold (DONE)
Compiles, CI green, structure correct, no domain logic.
- [x] Manifest, README, CHANGELOG, REPS, dual license, CI, deny, clippy, rustfmt.

## v0.2.0 - Core (THE HARD PART, NOT DEFERRED) (DONE)
Virtual/executable memory regions (mmap/VirtualAlloc, guard pages) - the foundation JIT needs.
Dependencies (none) - core path is dependency-free; `serde` stays optional, value-types only.
Exit criteria:
- [x] Every public item has rustdoc + a runnable example.
- [x] Core invariants property-tested; `docs/API.md` authored at this stage.

## v1.0.0 - API freeze
Public surface stable and frozen until 2.0.
- [ ] docs/API.md marked stable; SemVer promise recorded.
- [ ] Full test + benchmark suite green on all three platforms.
